## StayPress Enquiry plugin - Gravity Forms Add-on

The StayPress Enquiry plugin is a Gravity Forms addon that integrates the Property and Booking plugins with Gravity Forms.

It enables complex enquiry forms to be created using the Gravity Forms interface and bookings for properties made in the StayPress system, for those enquiries, directly from within the Gravity Forms interface.

## Installing

The enquiry plugin requires both Gravity Forms and the StayPress plugins to be installed and Activated. Once they are activted, simply activating the enquiry plugin will add in the relevant integration.

## Gravity Forms Integration

Once installed and activated you will see the new StayPress fields in the Gravity Forms interface. The fields are all set to be hidden, so they won't show on your actual form, but they will be included in any enquiry emails you receive and can be used in the emails sent to the enquirer by Gravity Forms.

Once an enquiry has been received, the add-on will recognise those enquiries that contain the extra fields and offer two new menu items - one in the enquiry list, and one in the enquiry details information box that will allow you to create a new booking directly from the information contained in the enquiry.
