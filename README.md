## StayPress Gravity Forms Add-on

The StayPress Gravity Forms addon integrates the Property and Booking plugins with Gravity Forms.

It enables complex enquiry forms to be created using the Gravity Forms interface and bookings for properties made in the StayPress system, for those enquiries, directly from within the Gravity Forms interface.

## Gravity Forms Integration

Once installed and activated you will see the new StayPress fields in the Gravity Forms interface. The fields are all set to be hidden, so they won't show on your actual form, but they will be included in any enquiry emails you receive and can be used in the emails sent to the enquirer by Gravity Forms.

Once an enquiry has been received, the add-on will recognise those enquiries that contain the extra fields and offer two new menu items - one in the enquiry list, and one in the enquiry details information box that will allow you to create a new booking directly from the information contained in the enquiry.

## Downloading

Stable downloads are available from the Downloads tab. If you want the latest development versions then you can use the Zip or Tar buttons, but you will need to rename the holding directory to something neater. We recommend calling it **sp_gfaddon**, but that's because we used that directory name when we were developing it.

## Installing

The enquiry plugin requires both Gravity Forms and the StayPress plugins to be installed and Activated. Once they are activted, simply activating the enquiry plugin will add in the relevant integration.
